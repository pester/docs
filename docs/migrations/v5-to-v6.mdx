description: See this guide for how to update your tests to be compatible with Pester v6.
---

Pester v6 builds upon the new runtime introduced in v5 and behaves mostly the same which ensures backwards-compatibility. This guide will highlight any necessary steps to update your code and environment to run Pester v6.

## Breaking Changes

### Removed support for PowerShell 3, 4, 5.0, 6, 7.0 and 7.1

To be able to support new functionality and modernize the codebase, Pester 6.0.0 dropped support for unsupported versions of PowerShell.
It currently requires Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7.2 and later, see [Installation](../introduction/installation#compatibility).

Make sure your computer and/or CI-systems are updated to run a supported version of PowerShell.

### Removed `Assert-MockCalled` and `Assert-VerifiableMock`

Both functions were deprecated and replaced in Pester v5 and has been fully removed in Pester v6. Replace:
- `Assert-MockCalled` with [Should -Invoke](../usage/mocking)
- `Assert-VerifiableMock` with [Should -InvokeVerifiable](../usage/mocking)

### Removed `Set-ItResult -Pending`

The Pending result was never fully implemented in v5 and has been removed in v6.

Replace any calls to `Set-ItResult -Pending` with `Set-ItResult -Inconclusive/-Skip` or mark the test using `It .. -Skip`.

### Discovery throws on empty `-ForEach` values

[Data-driven tests](../usage/data-driven-tests) will throw when provided `$null` or an empty array to `-ForEach/TestCases`. This makes it easier to detect common errors like referencing a variable that is not defined in `BeforeDiscovery` or provided as external data. Previously these tests and blocks would be silently ignored.

To allow empty data in specific blocks or tests, use the new `-AllowNullOrEmptyForEach` switch in `Describe/Context/It`.
To disable the new behavior globally, set the configuration option `Run.FailOnNullOrEmptyForEach` to `$false`.

## Changed Defaults

### Code Coverage defaults to the newer Profiler-based tracer

When using Code Coverage it will now run using the newer and faster Profiler-based tracer instead of using breakpoints.
The option `CodeCoverage.UseBreakpoints` is no longer experimental mode and the new default is `$false`.

To switch back to the older breakpoints-mode, set `CodeCoverage.UseBreakpoints` to `$true`.

:::warning Guide is incomplete
Like the v6 preview docs in general this guide is incomplete and will be updated as we release new builds.
