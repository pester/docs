## Actual breaking changes

- (❗ new in 5.0.1)  The Parameters of `Invoke-Pester` changed significantly, but in 5.0.1, a compatibility parameter set was added. To allow all the v4 parameters to be used, e.g. like this `Invoke-Pester -Script $testFile -PassThru -Verbose -OutputFile $tr -OutputFormat NUnitXml -CodeCoverage "$tmp/*-*.ps1" -CodeCoverageOutputFile $cc -Show All`. The compatibility is not 100%, neither -Script not -CodeCoverage take hashtables, they just take a collection of paths. The `-Strict` parameter and `-PesterOption` are ignored. The `-Output` \ `-Show` parameter takes all the values, but translates only the most used options to Pester 5 compatible options, otherwise it uses `Detailed` output. It also allows all the Pester 5 output options, to allow you to use `Diagnostic` during migration. This whole Parameter set is deprecated, and prints a warning. For more options and the Advanced interface see [simple and advanced interface](#simple-and-advanced-interface) above on how to invoke Pester.
- PowerShell 2 is no longer supported
- Documentation is out of date for all commands
- Legacy syntax `Should Be` (without `-`) is removed, see [Migrating from Pester v3 to v4](https://pester.dev/docs/migrations/v3-to-v4)
- Mocks are scoped based on their placement, not in whole `Describe` / `Context`. The count also depends on their placement. See [mock scoping](#mocks-are-scoped-based-on-their-placement)
- `Assert-VerifiableMocks` was removed, see [Should -Invoke](#should--invoke)
- All code placed in the body of `Describe` outside of `It`, `BeforeAll`, `BeforeEach`, `AfterAll`, `AfterEach` will run during discovery and it's state might or might not be available to the test code, see [basics of discovery](#basics-of-discovery)

- `-Output` parameter has reduced options to `None`, `Normal`, `Detailed` and `Diagnostic`, `-Show` alias is removed
- `-PesterOption` switch is removed
- `-TestName` switch is replaced with `-FullNameFilter` switch
- `-Script` option was renamed to `-Path` and takes paths only, it does not take hashtables. Parametrized scripts are not implemented at the moment, which should be solved in 5.1
- Using `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` to locate your script in `BeforeAll` does not work. This does not break it for your scripts and modules. Use `$PSScriptRoot` or `$PSCommandPath`. See [importing ps files](https://jakubjares.com/2020/04/11/pester5-importing-ps-files/) article for detailed information.
- Should `-Throw` is using `-like` to match the exception message instead of .Contains. Use `*` or any of the other `-like` wildcard to match only part of the message.
- Variables defined during Discovery, are not available in Before*, After* and It. When generating tests via foreach blocks, make sure you pass all variables into the test using -TestCases.
- Gherkin is removed, and will later move to it's own module, please keep using Pester version 4.
- `TestDrive` is defined during Run only, it cannot be used in -TestCases / -ForEach.

### Deprecated features

-  `Assert-MockCalled` is deprecated, it is recommended to use [Should -Invoke](#should--invoke)
-  `Assert-VerifiableMock` is deprecated, it is recommended to use [Should -InvokeVerifiable](#should--invoke)

### Additional issues to be solved in 5.1

- `-Strict` switch is not available
- Inconclusive and Pending states are currently no longer available, `-Pending` and `-Inconclusive` are translated to `-Skip` both on test blocks and when using `Set-ItResult`
- Code coverage report is not available.
- Automatic Code coverage via -CI switch is largely untested.
- Generating tests during using foreach during discovery time works mostly, generating them from BeforeAll, to postpone expensive work till it is needed in case the test is filtered out also works, but is hacky. Get in touch if you need it and help me refine it.
- Running on huge codebases is largely untested
- `IncludeVSCodeMarker` was renamed to `WriteVSCodeMarker` and moved to, PesterConfiguration object in Debug section. But it is not implemented and will be removed, I will detect VSCode by env variables
- Documentation is out of date for all commands
- Providing parameters to test scripts is not implemented, see [parametric scripts](https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/1485)
- JUnit output is missing
