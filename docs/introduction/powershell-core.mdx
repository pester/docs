Since version 4.1.0 Pester is compatible with
[PowerShell Core 6.x](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)
with some limitations listed below

- Pester unit tests for test a code coverage of DSC resources can't be executed
- DSC is not supported on MacOSX
- support on Linux [requires additional software to be installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/lnxgettingstarted).
  Please read also [DSC Future Direction Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/09/12/dsc-future-direction-update/)
  on the PowerShell Team Blog
- An error ```call depth overflow``` on macOS
  ([please check](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4268))
- the one failing test [in Pester Functions/Assertions/Be.Tests.ps1](https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/master/Functions/Assertions/Be.Tests.ps1)
  is disabled due that bug

Please remember that not only Pester need to be aligned to work on PowerShell Core 6.x.
Also your test need to be aligned - please check the reference
