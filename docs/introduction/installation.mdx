## Compatibility

Pester is a cross-platform module that runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS and anywhere else supported by PowerShell. It is tested and compatible with:
- Windows PowerShell 3.0 - 5.1
- PowerShell 6.0.4 and above

## Installing from PSGallery

From an PowerShell session run:

```powershell
# For all users (requires "Run as Administrator" on Windows)
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force

# For current user only
Install-Module -Name Pester -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

Or to update:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name Pester
```

### Special instructions for Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 and later

Pester version 3.4.0 shipped as part of Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016, making Pester availabe to many new users.
Unfortunately this version cannot be updated using the simple `Update-Module` cmdlet. Instead you need to perform a side-by-side installation of Pester to get the latest version.

The built-in version is signed by Microsoft while newer versions are community-maintained and signed with a different certificate,
causing `Install-Module` to throw a security error without a few extra parameters.

Run the command below _as administrator_ to install the latest version:
```powershell
# -Force = side-by-side installation.
# -SkipPublisherCheck = accept the newer certificate
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

:::note Removing the built-in version
If you'd like to remove the built-in version of Pester, you can do so using the following code:

```powershell
$module = "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Pester"
takeown /F $module /A /R
icacls $module /reset
icacls $module /grant "*S-1-5-32-544:F" /inheritance:d /T
Remove-Item -Path $module -Recurse -Force -Confirm:$false

# Install latest Pester
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force
```

For any subsequent update it is enough to run:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name Pester
```

### Common issues

#### TLS error while connecting to PSGallery
If you receive the following warning when trying to install the module, you may need to explicitly enable TLS 1.2.

```powershell
WARNING: Unable to resolve package source 'https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2'.

# Enable TLS 1.2 for the current PowerShell instance using the line below and try again
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

#### Command `Install-Module` command is missing

Older versions of Windows running Windows PowerShell 3.0 or 4.0 do not have a built-in package manager, but you can install `PowerShellGet` using the [instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget#for-computers-running-powershell-30-or-powershell-40). After completing the steps, start a new PowerShell session and retry [the module installation](#installing-from-psgallery).

Another alternative is installing the module manually using the instructions below.

Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 and later includes Windows PowerShell 5.1 and `PowerShellGet` out-of-the-box.

## Installing manually

You don't have to use a package manager to install Pester. Another option is to download and installating it manually which can be useful in e.g. offline envionments.

1. Download the module on a machine with internet using either:
    - **Recommended:** `Save-Module -Name Pester -Path C:\Temp`. It will save it in a versioned folder, ex *C:\Temp\Pester\5.5.0*
    - Or download the NuGet package from PowerShell Gallery and extract it, see [Manual Package Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/how-to/working-with-packages/manual-download)
2. Copy the Pester-folder (ex. *C:\Temp\Pester*) to your destination computer and place it in one of your module directories defined by [$env:PSModulePath](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_psmodulepath). On a Windows-system the default locations include:
    - **Current user:** *$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*
    - **All users:** *$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*
3. Start PowerShell and start testing.

:::tip
Step 2 is an optional step to enable simple import by name and module auto-loading. You could also import Pester using an absolute path like `Import-Module C:\Temp\Pester\5.5.0`.

## Alternative package sources

PSGallery is the easiest way to get Pester installed to your computer, but there are alternatives.
On a build server you might prefer using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), or if you're adding Pester to your .NET project that already uses [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) you might prefer that.

These options may not support pre-release versions and it may need to be initialized on first use.

### Chocolatey

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (or _choco_) is a commonly used package manager for Windows. You can install Pester using:

```powershell
choco install Pester
```

Or to update:

```powershell
choco upgrade Pester
```

You may also pass the `--prerelease` option to install or update to a prerelease version of Pester.

### Nuget

[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) is the package manager for .NET projects.
Getting Pester from Nuget is useful when you are integrating PowerShell code with your .NET project, and want to have that code tested.

To install use Package Manager of Visual Studio, or Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
Once you need this we are pretty sure you know what you are doing. :slightly_smiling_face:
