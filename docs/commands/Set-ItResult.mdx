## SYNOPSIS

Set-ItResult is used inside the It block to explicitly set the test result

## SYNTAX

### Inconclusive

```powershell
Set-ItResult [-Inconclusive] [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Skipped

```powershell
Set-ItResult [-Skipped] [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Sometimes a test shouldn't be executed, sometimes the condition cannot be evaluated.
By default such tests would typically fail and produce a big red message.
Using Set-ItResult it is possible to set the result from the inside of the It script
block to either inconclusive, or skipped.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Describe "Example" {
    It "Inconclusive test" {
        Set-ItResult -Inconclusive -Because "we want it to be inconclusive"
    }
    It "Skipped test" {
        Set-ItResult -Skipped -Because "we want it to be skipped"
    }
}
```

the output should be

```
Describing Example
  [?] Inconclusive test is inconclusive, because we want it to be inconclusive 35ms (32ms|3ms)
  [!] Skipped test is skipped, because we want it to be skipped 3ms (2ms|1ms)
Tests completed in 78ms
Tests Passed: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 1, Inconclusive: 1, NotRun: 0
```
