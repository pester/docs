## SYNOPSIS

Set-ItResult is used inside the It block to explicitly set the test result

## SYNTAX

### Inconclusive

```powershell
Set-ItResult [-Inconclusive] [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Pending

```powershell
Set-ItResult [-Pending] [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Skipped

```powershell
Set-ItResult [-Skipped] [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Sometimes a test shouldn't be executed, sometimes the condition cannot be evaluated.
By default such tests would typically fail and produce a big red message.
Using Set-ItResult it is possible to set the result from the inside of the It script
block to either inconclusive, pending or skipped.

As of Pester 5, there is no "Inconclusive" or "Pending" test state, so all tests will now go to state skipped,
however the test result notes will include information about being inconclusive or testing to keep this command
backwards compatible

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Describe "Example" {
    It "Skipped test" {
        Set-ItResult -Skipped -Because "we want it to be skipped"
    }
}
```

the output should be

```
[!] Skipped test is skipped, because we want it to be skipped
Tests completed in 0ms
Tests Passed: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Pending: 0, Inconclusive 1
```
