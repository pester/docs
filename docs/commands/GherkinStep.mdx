## SYNOPSIS

A step in a test, also known as a Given, When, or Then

## SYNTAX

```powershell
GherkinStep [-Name] <String> [-Test] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Pester doesn't technically distinguish between the three kinds of steps.
However, we strongly recommend that you do!
These words were carefully selected to convey meaning which is crucial to get you into the BDD mindset.

In BDD, we drive development by not first stating the requirements, and then defining steps which can be
executed in a manner that is similar to unit tests.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
# Gherkin Steps need to be placed in a *.Step.ps1 file

# filename: copyfile.Step.ps1

Given 'we have a destination folder' {
    mkdir testdrive:\target -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    'testdrive:\target' | Should Exist
}

When 'we call Copy-Item' {
    { Copy-Item testdrive:\source\something.txt testdrive:\target } | Should Not Throw
}

Then 'we have a new file in the destination' {
    'testdrive:\target\something.txt' | Should Exist
}

# Steps need to allign with feature specifications in a *.feature file

# filename: copyfile.feature
Feature: You can copy one file

Scenario: The file exists, and the target folder exists
    Given we have a source file
    And we have a destination folder
    When we call Copy-Item
    Then we have a new file in the destination
    And the new file is the same as the original file
```

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
# This example shows a complex regex match that can be used for multiple lines in the feature specification

# The named match is mapped to the script parameter

# filename: namedregex.Step.ps1

Given 'we have a (?\<name\>\S*) function' {
    param($name)
    "$psscriptroot\..\MyModule\*\$name.ps1" | Should Exist
}

# filename: namedregex.feature

Scenario: basic feature support
    Given we have public functions
    And we have a New-Node function
    And we have a New-Edge function
    And we have a New-Graph function
    And we have a New-Subgraph function
```

## PARAMETERS

### -Name

The name of a gherkin step is actually a regular expression, from which capturing groups
are cast and passed to the parameters in the ScriptBlock

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Test

The ScriptBlock which defines this step.
May accept parameters from regular expression
capturing groups (named or not), or from tables or multiline strings.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
