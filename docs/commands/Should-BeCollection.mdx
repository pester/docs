## SYNOPSIS

Compares collections for equality, by comparing their sizes and each item in them.
It does not compare the types of the input collections.

## SYNTAX

### Expected

```powershell
Should-BeCollection [[-Actual] <Object>] [-Expected] <Object> [-Because <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Count

```powershell
Should-BeCollection [[-Actual] <Object>] [-Because <String>] [-Count <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

\{\{ Fill in the Description \}\}

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
1, 2, 3 | Should-BeCollection @(1, 2, 3)
@(1) | Should-BeCollection @(1)
1 | Should-BeCollection 1
```

This assertion will pass, because the collections have the same size and the items are equal.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
1, 2, 3, 4 | Should-BeCollection @(1, 2, 3)
1, 2, 3, 4 | Should-BeCollection @(5, 6, 7, 8)
@(1) | Should-BeCollection @(2)
1 | Should-BeCollection @(2)
```

The assertions will fail because the collections are not equal.
