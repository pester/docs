## SYNOPSIS

Defines a series of steps to perform at the end of the current container,
Context or Describe block.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
AfterAll [-Scriptblock] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

AfterAll is used to share teardown after all the tests in a container, Describe
or Context including all child blocks and tests.
AfterAll runs during Run phase
and runs only once in the current block.
It's guaranteed to run even if tests
fail.

The typical usage is to clean up state or temporary used in tests.

BeforeAll and AfterAll are unique in that they apply to the entire container,
Context or Describe block regardless of the order of the statements compared to
other Context or Describe blcoks at the same level.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Describe "Validate important file" {
    BeforeAll {
        $samplePath = "$([IO.Path]::GetTempPath())/$([Guid]::NewGuid()).txt"
        Write-Host $samplePath
        1..100 | Set-Content -Path $samplePath
    }

    It "File Contains 100 lines" {
        @(Get-Content $samplePath).Count | Should -Be 100
    }

    It "First ten lines should be 1 -\> 10" {
        @(Get-Content $samplePath -TotalCount 10) | Should -Be @(1..10)
    }

    AfterAll {
        Remove-Item -Path $samplePath
    }
}
```

This example uses AfterAll to clean up a sample-file generated only for
the tests in the Describe-block.
