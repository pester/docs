## SYNOPSIS

Runs setup code that is used during Discovery phase.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
BeforeDiscovery [-ScriptBlock] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Runs your code as is, in the place where this function is defined.
This is a semantic block to allow you
to be explicit about code that you need to run during Discovery, instead of just
putting code directly inside of Describe / Context.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
PS \> BeforeDiscovery {
    $files = "file1.txt", "file2.txt"
}

Describe "File tests" {
    foreach ($file in $files) {
        It "test" {
            # ...

test code
        }
    }
}
```

The result of commands will be execution of tests and saving results of them in a NUnitMXL file where the root "test-suite"
will be named "Tests - Set A".
