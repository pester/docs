## Advanced interface

Advanced interface uses `PesterConfiguration` object which contains all options that you can provide to Pester and contains descriptions for all the configuration sections and as well as default values. Here is what you see when you look at the default Debug section of the object:

```powershell
(New-PesterConfiguration).Debug | Format-List

ShowFullErrors         : Show full errors including Pester internal stack. This property is deprecated, and if set to true it will override Output.StackTraceVerbosity to 'Full'. (False, default: False)
WriteDebugMessages     : Write Debug messages to screen. (False, default: False)
WriteDebugMessagesFrom : Write Debug messages from a given source, WriteDebugMessages must be set to true for this to work. You can use like wildcards to get messages from multiple sources, as well as * to get
                         everything. (System.String[], default: System.String[])
ShowNavigationMarkers  : Write paths after every block and test, for easy navigation in VSCode. (False, default: False)
ReturnRawResultObject  : Returns unfiltered result object, this is for development only. Do not rely on this object for additional properties, non-public properties will be renamed without previous notice. (False,
                         default: False)
```

The configuration object can be constructed either via the Default static property or by casting a hashtable to it. You can also cast a hashtable to any of its sections. Here are three different ways to the same goal:

```powershell
# import module before creating the object
Import-Module Pester
# get default from static property
$configuration = New-PesterConfiguration
# adding properties & discover via intellisense
$configuration.Run.Path = 'C:\projects\tst'
$configuration.Filter.Tag = 'Acceptance'
$configuration.Filter.ExcludeTag = 'WindowsOnly'
$configuration.Should.ErrorAction = 'Continue'
$configuration.CodeCoverage.Enabled = $true
```

```powershell
# cast whole hashtable to configuration
$configuration = [PesterConfiguration]@{
    Run = @{
        Path = 'C:\projects\tst'
    }
    Filter = @{
        Tag = 'Acceptance'
        ExcludeTag = 'WindowsOnly'
    }
    Should = @{
        ErrorAction = 'Continue'
    }
    CodeCoverage = @{
        Enabled = $true
    }
}
```

```powershell
# cast from empty hashtable to get default
$configuration = [PesterConfiguration]@{}
$configuration.Run.Path = 'C:\projects\tst'
# cast hashtable to section
$configuration.Filter = @{
        Tag = 'Acceptance'
        ExcludeTag = 'WindowsOnly'
    }
$configuration.Should.ErrorAction = 'Continue'
$configuration.CodeCoverage.Enabled = $true
```

This configuration object contains all the options that are currently supported and the Simple interface is internally translates to this object internally. It is the source of truth for the defaults and configuration. The Intermediate api will be figured out later, as well as all the other details.

## PesterPreference

There is one more way to provide the configuration object which is `$PesterPreference`. On `Invoke-Pester` (in case of interactive execution `Invoke-Pester` is called inside of the first `Describe`) the preference is collected and merged with the configuration object if provided. This allows you to configure everything that you would via Invoke-Pester also when you are running interactively (via `F5`). You can also use this to define the defaults for your session by putting $PesterPreference into your PowerShell profile.

Here is a simple example of enabling Mock logging output while running interactively :

```powershell
$PesterPreference = New-PesterConfiguration
$PesterPreference.Debug.WriteDebugMessages = $true
$PesterPreference.Debug.WriteDebugMessagesFrom = "Mock"

BeforeAll {
    function a { "hello" }
}
Describe "pester preference" {
    It "mocks" {
        Mock a { "mock" }
        a | Should -Be "mock"
    }
}
```

## PesterConfiguration Options

<!--GENERATED_PESTER_CONFIGURATION_DOCS_START-->

*This configuration documentation is generated from Pester 6.0.0-alpha1.*

### Run

Run configuration.

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|--------|-------------|-----:|--------:|
| Path | Directories to be searched for tests, paths directly to test files, or combination of both. | `string[]` | `@('.')` |
| ExcludePath | Directories or files to be excluded from the run. | `string[]` | `@()` |
| ScriptBlock | ScriptBlocks containing tests to be executed. | `scriptblock[]` | `@()` |
| Container | ContainerInfo objects containing tests to be executed. | `ContainerInfo[]` | `@()` |
| TestExtension | Filter used to identify test files. | `string` | `'.Tests.ps1'` |
| Exit | Exit with non-zero exit code when the test run fails. Exit code is always set to `$LASTEXITCODE` even when this option is `$false`. When used together with Throw, throwing an exception is preferred. | `bool` | `$false` |
| Throw | Throw an exception when test run fails. When used together with Exit, throwing an exception is preferred. | `bool` | `$false` |
| PassThru | Return result object to the pipeline after finishing the test run. | `bool` | `$false` |
| SkipRun | Runs the discovery phase but skips run. Use it with PassThru to get object populated with all tests. | `bool` | `$false` |
| SkipRemainingOnFailure | Skips remaining tests after failure for selected scope, options are None, Run, Container and Block. | `string` | `'None'` |

### Filter
