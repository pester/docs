Pester offers multiple options to customize the console output to your preference. These settings are available in the Output-section of PesterConfiguration.

```powershell
$conf = New-PesterConfiguration
$conf.Output                   

Verbosity           : The verbosity of output, options are None, Normal, Detailed and Diagnostic. (Normal, default: Normal)
StackTraceVerbosity : The verbosity of stacktrace output, options are None, FirstLine, Filtered and Full. (Filtered, default: Filtered)
```

This page focuses on the general options available for all users. See [VSCode](./vscode) for settings and features specific to using Pester with VSCode.

### Verbosity

This option controls the general level of console output. Pester v5 supports the following levels:

- **None**: No console output is shown. Typically used in combination with `Run.PassThru / -PassThru` to do custom post-processing of the results.
- **Normal (default)**: Focuses on successful containers and failed tests/blocks. Shows basic discovery information and the summary of all tests.<br/>

- **Detailed**: Similar to Normal, but this level shows all blocks and tests, including successful.<br/>
![Detailed verbosity](./images/output-detailed.png)
- **Diagnostic**: Very verbose, but useful when troubleshooting tests. This level beahves like Detailed, but also enables debug-messages. It enforces common debug message categories as a minimum, but additional levels can be enabled by appending to the list in `Debug.WriteDebugMessagesFrom`.<br/>

### StackTraceVerbosity

**New in Pester 5.3!**
When an error is shown due to a failed setup or test, a stacktrace is included to help you identify where the problem occured. End-users might not care much about this while developers need it to identify and fix issues.
This options lets you control how much of the stacktrace that will be printed. The following levels are currently supported:

- **None**: No stacktrace is shown, only the error message.<br/>

- **FirstLine**: Only show the first line of the stacktrace. This typically shows which line in your test that failed to get you started troubleshooting.<br/>

- **Filtered (default)**: Shows stacktrace related to your code. Filters out lines related to Pester-runtime.<br/>
![Filtered stacktrace](./images/stacktrace-filtered.png)
- **Full**: Shows unfiltered stacktrace including calls made by Pester-runtime. Mostly used for troubleshooting. This is the same as the option `Debug.ShowFullErrors = $true` used prior to Pester v5.3.<br/>

:::tip Error details are always available in the result-object
The result-object returned from `Run.PassThru / -PassThru` includes a `ErrorRecord`-property in all blocks/tests with full stacktrace and more, even if you've limited the console output using the options above.
