description: Skipping tests can be useful in many scenarios or when certain conditions are not met like OS-compatibility. Read about how to control this in Pester tests

### Skip on everything

`-Skip` is now available on Describe and Context. This allows you to skip all the tests in that block and every child block.

```powershell
Describe "describe1" {
    Context "with one skipped test" {
        It "test 1" -Skip {
            1 | Should -Be 2
        }

        It "test 2" {
            1 | Should -Be 1
        }
    }

    Describe "that is skipped" -Skip {
        It "test 3" {
            1 | Should -Be 2
        }
    }

    Context "that is skipped and has skipped test" -Skip {
        It "test 3" -Skip {
            1 | Should -Be 2
        }

        It "test 3" {
            1 | Should -Be 2
        }
    }
}
```

Pending is translated to skipped, Inconclusive does not exist anymore.

### Conditional skip

Evaluation of the skip-parameter is done as part of the Discovery-phase. This means you can also dynamically skip tests based on values available in that phase. Either as logic done in BeforeDiscovery or based on values passed into a parametrized test.

```powershell
$sb = {
    param($SkipFirst)

    Describe 'My Describe Block' {
        BeforeDiscovery {
            $skipSecond = 1
        }

        It 'First Test' -Skip:$SkipFirst {
            1 | Should -Be 1
        }

        It 'Second Test' -Skip:($skipSecond -eq 1) {
            1 | Should -Be 1
        }

        It 'Third Test' {
            1 | Should -Be 1
        }
    }
}

$container = New-PesterContainer -ScriptBlock $sb -Data @{ SkipFirst = $true }
$configuration = New-PesterConfiguration
$configuration.Run.Container = $container
$configuration.Output.Verbosity = 'Detailed'

Invoke-Pester -Configuration $configuration
