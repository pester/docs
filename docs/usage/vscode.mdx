### VSCode improvements

#### Use legacy code lens

With Pester 5 it is finally possible to run and debug just a single test in VSCode!

In the latest [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) extension for VSCode you can enable Use Legacy Code Lens option which will enable `Run tests` on all `Describe`, `Context` and `It` blocks. You can run a whole block, any child block, or any test individually. You can also run tests that are marked as skipped by running them individually.

Actually there is a bug, and the option is called Enable Legacy Code Lens, and is enabled by default and can't be disabled. üòÅ Take advantage of this and go try it right now!

#### Output verbosity

You can specify verbosity in VSCode, to see normal or detailed output, or to take it from PesterPreference. This also works for Pester 4!
