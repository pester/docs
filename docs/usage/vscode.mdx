Using Visual Studio Code with the latest [PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) is a great combination for writing PowerShell code. The extenstion even includes a few Pester-specific features to improve the way you write, run and debug Pester tests.

### Code lens

With the `Pester: Code Lens` setting enabled, VSCode will show `Run tests` or `Debug tests` links above your Pester blocks for quick execution. Starting with Pester 5 this also works on individual tests. You can even run tests that are marked as skipped by running them individually.

To enable the improved code lens for Pester 5 you need to disable the "Use Legacy Code Lens" setting which is enabled by default.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open **File | Preferences | Settings** (<kbd>âŒ˜/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>)
2. In the **Settings** window, navigate to the **Extensions | PowerShell** section.
3. Uncheck the **Pester: Use Legacy Code Lens** checkbox.
4. Close the **Settings** window.

### Output verbosity

You can control the output verbosity level in VSCode output, or let it inherit from PesterPreference.

### Outline view

You can easily navigate larger tests files using the Outline view. This includes all your Pester blocks, tests and setup/teardown as you'd expect.
