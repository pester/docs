description: How to suggest a new feature or improvement to the Pester PowerShell-module
---

To propose a new feature, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/new/choose) and share as much information as you see fit. Especially what the proposed feature is, why it is useful, and what dependencies (if any) it has. It would also be great if you added one or two examples of real world usage, if you have any.

When we discuss new features we look at how useful it is to the majority of users, how difficult it would be to implement, if breaking changes to the API must be introduced to have it, and if it's too specialized or too general to put in the codebase. But again, don't let that scare you away.
