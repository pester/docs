# Pester Docs

This repository contains the source files used to generate the [pester.dev](https://pester.dev) website.

The website pages are written in markdown files using the `.mdx` format and are located in the `/docs` folder.

ðŸ”¥ **One exception**: the pages in the "Command Reference" section are auto-generated using Pester's
[Comment Based Help](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help?view=powershell-7.1). Therefore, please do not create pull requests for these command reference pages here but instead, fix the corresponding
Pester Powershell source code (as found inside the [pester/pester](https://github.com/pester/pester)
repository).

## Contributing

To submit an update:

1. update the markdown `.mdx` file(s)
2. submit a pull request

## Local Development

The website is built using:

- [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator written in React
- [Alt3.Docusaurus.Powershell](https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/), a Powershell Get-Help to markdown generator

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Installation

To install all required dependencies and start a local development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

## Website Customization

Because the website is using Docusaurus as the underlying technology:

- please refer to the [Docusaurus 2 Documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) for usage information
  and available customization options
- please report technical issues at the [Docusaurus Repository](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues)

### Styling

The global CSS overrides for the Pester website are found in `src/css/custom.css`

### Tables

The Pester website uses interactive React tables. To change the content of the tables,
simply update the correlating `.json` configuration file as can be seen in
[this example](https://github.com/pester/docs/blob/master/docs/additional-resources/articles.table.js).

### Bumping Docusaurus

To upgrade docusaurus to a more recent version:

1. Edit `package.json`
2. Manually bump the version number of these dependency packages:
    ```json
    @docusaurus/core": "^2.0.0-alpha.62",
    @docusaurus/preset-classic": "^2.0.0-alpha.62",
    ```
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Submit a pull request with (only) these updated files:
   - `package.json`
   - `yarn.lock`
