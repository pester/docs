Pester provides a set of Mocking functions making it easy to fake dependencies and also to verify behavior. Using these mocking functions can allow you to "shim" a data layer or mock other complex functions that already have their own tests.

## Description

With the set of Mocking functions that Pester exposes, one can:

* Mock the behavior of ANY powershell command.
* Verify that specific commands were (or were not) called.
* Verify the number of times a command was called with a set of specified parameters.

## Mocking Functions

### Mock

Mocks the behavior of an existing command with an alternate implementation.

### Assert-VerifiableMocks

Checks if any Verifiable Mock has not been invoked. If so, this will throw an exception.

### Assert-MockCalled

Checks if a Mocked command has been called a certain number of times and throws an exception if it has not.

## Example

```powershell
function Build ($version) {
    Write-Host "a build was run for version: $version"
}

function BuildIfChanged {
    $thisVersion = Get-Version
    $nextVersion = Get-NextVersion
    if ($thisVersion -ne $nextVersion) { Build $nextVersion }
    return $nextVersion
}

$here = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
$sut = (Split-Path -Leaf $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path) -replace '\.Tests\.', '.'
. "$here\$sut"

Describe "BuildIfChanged" {
    Context "When there are Changes" {
        Mock Get-Version {return 1.1}
        Mock Get-NextVersion {return 1.2}
        Mock Build {} -Verifiable -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1.2}

        $result = BuildIfChanged

        It "Builds the next version" {
            Assert-VerifiableMocks
        }
        It "returns the next version number" {
            $result | Should Be 1.2
        }
    }
    Context "When there are no Changes" {
        Mock Get-Version { return 1.1 }
        Mock Get-NextVersion { return 1.1 }
        Mock Build {}

        $result = BuildIfChanged

        It "Should not build the next version" {
            Assert-MockCalled Build -Times 0 -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1.1}
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to mock calls to commands which are made from inside a Script Module, additional code is required.  For details, refer to [Unit Testing within Modules](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Unit-Testing-within-Modules)

### Mocking a function that is called by a method in a PowerShell class

In PowerShell 6, functions called by classes can be mocked as above, with no known problems.

However previous versions of PowerShell, including **all** versions of Windows PowerShell up to 5.1 cache class definitions in such a way that they are never redefined, even if you remove the module and re-import, or modify the class. This breaks Pester's Mock command, as the scope where the mock must be injected cannot be found.

Dave Wyatt has provided this workaround:

> Simply run your Pester tests in a fresh session every time; this is simple to do with Start-Job. I have this proxy function in my PowerShell profile to help with that:

```powershell
function Invoke-PesterJob
{
[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName='LegacyOutputXml')]
    param(
        [Parameter(Position=0)]
        [Alias('Path','relative_path')]
        [System.Object[]]
        ${Script},

        [Parameter(Position=1)]
        [Alias('Name')]
        [string[]]
        ${TestName},

        [Parameter(Position=2)]
        [switch]
        ${EnableExit},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='LegacyOutputXml', Position=3)]
        [string]
        ${OutputXml},

        [Parameter(Position=4)]
        [Alias('Tags')]
        [string[]]
        ${Tag},

        [string[]]
        ${ExcludeTag},

        [switch]
        ${PassThru},

        [System.Object[]]
        ${CodeCoverage},

        [switch]
        ${Strict},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='NewOutputSet', Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]
        ${OutputFile},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='NewOutputSet', Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateSet('LegacyNUnitXml','NUnitXml')]
        [string]
        ${OutputFormat},

        [switch]
        ${Quiet}
    )

    $params = $PSBoundParameters

    Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Set-Location $using:pwd; Invoke-Pester @using:params } |
    Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob
}
Set-Alias ipj Invoke-PesterJob

```
