## SYNOPSIS

Checks if any Verifiable Mock has not been invoked.
If so, this will throw an exception.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Assert-VerifiableMock [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This can be used in tandem with the -Verifiable switch of the Mock
function.
Mock can be used to mock the behavior of an existing command
and optionally take a -Verifiable switch.
When Assert-VerifiableMock
is called, it checks to see if any Mock marked Verifiable has not been
invoked.
If any mocks have been found that specified -Verifiable and
have not been invoked, an exception will be thrown.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Mock Set-Content {} -Verifiable -ParameterFilter {$Path -eq "some_path" -and $Value -eq "Expected Value"}

{ ...some code that never calls Set-Content some_path -Value "Expected Value"...
}

Assert-VerifiableMock
```

This will throw an exception and cause the test to fail.

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Mock Set-Content {} -Verifiable -ParameterFilter {$Path -eq "some_path" -and $Value -eq "Expected Value"}

Set-Content some_path -Value "Expected Value"

Assert-VerifiableMock
```

This will not throw an exception because the mock was invoked.
