## SYNOPSIS

Defines a series of steps to perform at the beginning of every It block within
the current Context or Describe block.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
BeforeEach [-Scriptblock] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

BeforeEach runs once before every test in the current or any child blocks.
Typically this is used to create all the prerequisites for the current test,
such as writing content to a file.

BeforeEach and AfterEach are unique in that they apply to the entire Context
or Describe block, regardless of the order of the statements in the
Context or Describe.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Describe "File parsing" {
    BeforeEach {
        # randomized path, to get fresh file for each test
        $file = "$([IO.Path]::GetTempPath())/$([Guid]::NewGuid())_form.xml"
        Copy-Item -Source $template -Destination $file -Force | Out-Null
    }

    It "Writes username" {
        Write-XmlForm -Path $file -Field "username" -Value "nohwnd"
        $content = Get-Content $file
        # ...
    }

    It "Writes name" {
        Write-XmlForm -Path $file -Field "name" -Value "Jakub"
        $content = Get-Content $file
        # ...
    }
}
```

The example uses BeforeEach to ensure a clean sample-file is used for each test.
