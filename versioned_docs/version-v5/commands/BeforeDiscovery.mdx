## SYNOPSIS

Runs setup code that is used during Discovery phase.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
BeforeDiscovery [-ScriptBlock] <ScriptBlock> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Runs your code as is, in the place where this function is defined.
This is a semantic block to allow you
to be explicit about code that you need to run during Discovery, instead of just
putting code directly inside of Describe / Context.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
BeforeDiscovery {
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $PSScriptRoot -Filter '*.ps1' -Recurse
}

Describe "File - <_>" -ForEach $files {
    Context "Whitespace" {
        It "There is no extra whitespace following a line" {
            # ...
        }

        It "File ends with an empty line" {
            # ...
        }
    }
}
```

BeforeDiscovery is used to gather a list of script-files during Discovery-phase to
dynamically create a Describe-block and tests for each file found.
